Angular Notes: 
- Angular is a front-end framework used for creating single-page applications (SPAs).
- The idea behind SPAs is that all the necessary code can be retrieved in a single page load or dynamically loaded as necessary.
- Data is sent to and received from the server using Ajax requests
AJAX: Communication object
Templating: To avoid mixing HTML into the json data returned by the server.
Routing: Routing allows you to select a piece of the application to display without requiring a page load.
