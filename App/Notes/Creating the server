To do: 
View employees as a list
Make employee resources RESTful
The RESTful design pattern also lines up cleanly with the employee operations we require for our application, namely create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD). 


Structure of files
|____database
| |____employees.json
|____index.js
|____lib
|____node_modules
| |____colors
|____package.json
|____public
| |____home.html
| |____style.css

I use employees.json as a database that we can query.
