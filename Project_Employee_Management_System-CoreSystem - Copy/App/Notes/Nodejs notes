Node Notes: 

- JavaScript, the language, is the same both client-side and server-side using Node. 

The Problem with I/O:
- Any non-trivial web server will eventually have to execute some I/O.
- slowest part of any systemis I/O 
- The cost of I/O over a network is segnificantly slower 240G cycles
- Here are the steps of the life cycle:
a) Request comes from server 
b) Rmote server hosts database, server sends query to database. 
c) Database runs query 
d) Database responds to server
e) server con=nverts data to JSON
f) Server reads from local html file to display results 
g) The server responds to the request and returns HTML with all the red cars in our database.

"As you can see this leads to the delay in I/O, I/O activity that blocks other processing from happen in a running program is known as blocking I/O."
- Multiple requests would bottle neck the system 
- Node.js is a nnon blocking language
- It achives this by using Callbacks.
- A callback is a function that is executed when I/O operations finish or produce an error. 
- Node is not designed for labour entensive applications
