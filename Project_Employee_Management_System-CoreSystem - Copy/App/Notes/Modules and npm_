- Simply executing npm install will install all the modules listed in the package.json file in the current directory
- express-generator adds a command to the terminal that lets the user create a generic ExpressJS application server 
- Modules are wrapped 
    (function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {
    // The code we write will be here
    });
