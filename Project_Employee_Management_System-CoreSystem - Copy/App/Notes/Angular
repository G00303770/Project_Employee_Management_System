Angular Notes: 
- Angular is a front-end framework used for creating single-page applications (SPAs).
- The idea behind SPAs is that all the necessary code can be retrieved in a single page load or dynamically loaded as necessary.
- Data is sent to and received from the server using Ajax requests
AJAX: Communication object
Templating: To avoid mixing HTML into the json data returned by the server.
Routing: Routing allows you to select a piece of the application to display without requiring a page load. 


- the biggest advantages of SPAs are improved performance and a more fluid user experience due to reduced page loads and smaller server transactions.
- Browser history can effect SPAs
- data binding 
Model-View-Controller Architecture
- Angular brings the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture to front-end web applications.
- Under the MVC approach, the model defines the application at a data layer, independent of the user interface.
- In Angular applications, controllers are JavaScript functions that are registered with the application using the controller() method.


The Meaning of ng
In Angular applications, you’ll see attributes or tags that start with "ng". 
This alerts you to the attribute or tag being Angular-specific, 
and will let you look up the documentation on the Angular website.

The ng-app attribute is used to instruct Angular that the html element is 
the root element for this application. In general, you’ll see this attribute on the html or body tags. 
If you forget to useit, none of the Angular code will execute.
