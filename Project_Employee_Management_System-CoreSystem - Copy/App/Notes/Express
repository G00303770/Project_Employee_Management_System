- Express is a Node module that provides a thin web application framework around the core Node modules 
- open sourced 
- Express provides request routing, a static file server, view engine integration, and a plethora of community modules.
 
 The Building Blocks of Express
- An Express server can be broken down into three building blocks: the router, routes, and middleware.

Router: 
- The core of any web server is robust request routing. 
- simpily the client requests a resource, the server tries to locate the resource and if it's found, respond in a way that the client is expecting.
- The order in which routes are added to the router is very important. 

Static Files 
- A web server must have a simple way to serve static files.

Middleware
- Middleware is any JavaScript function that has the function signature function (req, res, next).
- A request is considered complete when a middleware function sends a response to the client.
